 <h1>Ranking Final Fantasy Games that I've Played So Far</h1>
 <P>Hi! I'm Rune and I like playing role-playing games (RPGs). Final Fantasy, however, was the one that introduced me to the genre. Here's my ranking of the Final Fantasy's I've played so far!</P>
 <hr />
 <h2>1. Final Fantasy X</h2>
 <p>This one holds a special place in my heart. Final Fantasy X (FFX) released when I was a teenager and when I rewatched its story and gameplay now that I'm an adult, it still pulls some heart strings.</p>
 <p>The battle system, graphics, story, and even ost is super ahead of its time. It's a big leap from the last installment from PS1. Sure the graphics and the voice acting may be dated at this point, but considering what year it was active, boy is it a gem.</p>
 <h2>2. Final Fantasy XII (Zodiac Age)</h2>
 <p>Now this one is a bit controversial since not a lot of people liked Final Fantasy XII (FFXII) for reasons like:<br />
a. battle system is DIFFERENT. not solid-ly the turn-based system. some may even argue that it's MMO-like.<br />
b. story and character development is POOR. Some even say that the main character's (Vaan) personality is so weak.<br />
</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, these add flavor to the Final Fantasy franchise. A setting made in a recurring world (Ivalice, the same worlds as FF Tactics and Vagrant Story), a storyline that centers on the character group instead of a central character, 
 and a politcal-heavy theme instead of magic/fantasy heavy one. Of course if I'm bombarded with the same theme again and again (be it political heavy or not), it would get old easily.</p>
<h2>3. Final Fantasy IX</h2>
 <h2>4. Final Fantasy VII</h2>
 <h2>5. Final Fantasy I</h2>
 <h2>6. Final Fantasy XIV</h2>
