<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Marlon and I'm a newbie web designer! Currently, I only know some HTML basics and this website is actually one of my first projects.</p>

<p>Aside from webdesigning, I also graduated science courses - Biology and Medicine. One of the reasons I want to learn of webdesigning is because: 
  1. computer and internet is the present and probably the future and 2. health informatics is pretty bad</p>

<p>Aside from those boring stuff, I also like gaming! Right now (2025), I'm into DOTA2, Final Fantasy, and roguelite survivor games! Who knows, maybe
  next time I'll go into game designing too! I know it's a longshot, but what have I to lose aside from time.</p>
